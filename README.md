# SkaPy
This SkaPy is sa Python script created to process linear scanline survey datasets.
The Skapy_script1 runs a classification of the fractures into structural sets,
  then the script calculates the statistical distributions of the fractures, their aperture and trace length, 
  - for the whole fracture together
  - separated per outcrop,
  - or separated per lithology.
  
 If you would need a dataset to run an example, please feel free to contact me at:
